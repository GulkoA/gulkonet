## TL;DR

Collision is a project my team made in 24 hours during the [2022 HackOHI/O Hackathon](https://hack.osu.edu/2022), winning **4th place out of 200 teams**. Collision is a web application that integrates with Google Calendar and helps users find the best time for a meeting by comparing the availability of all participants.
