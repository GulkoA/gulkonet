# Orerereo

It all started with this meme:

<Figure filenames={["oreo-meme.jpg"]} alt="Oreo meme" width="400" loading="eager"/>

The origin of the Oreo cookie name is its structure: two chocolate wafers (o's) with a cream filling (re) in the middle. So, what if there was a website to change this structure and create your own custom orerereoo cookie? This idea intersected with a will to learn CSS animations, and here we go:

<div class="unmargin">
<iframe width="100%" height="700px" src="https://oreo.gulko.net" />
</div>

This was built in a day with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website is fully responsive and works on mobile. Hosted on [oreo.gulko.net](https://oreo.gulko.net), code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/GulkoA/Oreo).
