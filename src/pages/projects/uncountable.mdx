# TL;DR
Uncountable is a project my team made during the [2023 HackOHI/O Hackathon](https://hack.osu.edu/2023), winning **1st place out of 200 teams**. It uses computer vision to detect the movement of all surgical instruments during a procedure and alerts the surgeon if any are left in the patient.

# Problem

For the 2023 HackOHI/O Hackathon, my team (David Novikov, Michael Lin, Zeyad Mansour) and I decided to take on the challenge of preventing [RSI (Retained Surgical Instruments)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retained_surgical_instruments). Approximately 1,500 RSI incidents occur each year in the United States alone [^1].

The currently most used method to prevent RSI is manual counting, which is prone to human error. Another alternative is using RFID tags attached to every Instrument, however this is expensive and not widely adopted. We wanted to create a solution that was both accurate and cost-effective.

# Process

To create a computer vision software we first needed some hardware: A cardboard box to simulate a patient's body and a top-down web camera to capture the movement of the instruments. We found both in a matter of 30 minutes (running all around campus) and started the works.

We decided to base our model off YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art object detection model. To improve its performance for our usecase, we collected a custom dataset of plastic knives, scissors, and tissues in the view of the camera to fine-tune the model.

# Solution

Our approach was to use a system consisting of a camera,
